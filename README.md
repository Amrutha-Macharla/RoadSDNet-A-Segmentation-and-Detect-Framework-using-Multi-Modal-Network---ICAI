# RoadSDNet-A-Segmentation-and-Detect-Framework-using-Multi-Modal-Network---ICAI
This paper addresses a novel algorithm, RoadSDNet for road boundary detection and segmentation. This algorithm can be easily deployed in real time as it consumes very little computational time giving a significant accuracy.
